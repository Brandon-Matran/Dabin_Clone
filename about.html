                      Dabin is a JUNO nominated music producer &amp;
                      instrumentalist originally from Toronto. Having spent his
                      teens learning to play the piano, drums and guitar, Dabin
                      started producing electronic music in 2011.

                    <p><br /></p>
                    <p>
                      Dabin has gained hundreds of millions of plays while
                      refining his musical style into what it is today. His work
                      includes high profile collaborations with Seven Lions,
                      Slander, Said The Sky and remixes for Illenium &amp;
                      Gramatik.

                    <p>
                      He released his sophomore album ”Wild Youth” in March 2019
                      via MrSuicideSheep’s label, Seeking Blue, which he then
                      stripped down into an acoustic EP in 2020. Dabin
                      distinguishes himself with a unique genre-defying live
                      show in which he incorporates electronic guitar,
                      synthesizers and drum pads.
